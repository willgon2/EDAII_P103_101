# Developer Setup

## Linux

1. Install GCC
```zsh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install gdb
sudo apt install valgrind
sudo apt install clang-format
gcc --version
```

2. Create your group repository from the template (instructions in the groups spreadsheet)

3. [Clone the repository using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_clone-a-repository-locally)
   
5. Run `make r` and make sure you see this message: `Welcome to EDA 2!`

## MacOS

1. [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

1. [Install GCC](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc#default)

2. [Install GDB](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gdb#default)

3. [Install make](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make#default)

4. [Install clang-format](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/clang-format#default)

5. Create your group repository from the template (instructions in the groups spreadsheet)

6. [Clone the repository using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_clone-a-repository-locally)
   
8. Run `make r` and make sure you see this message: `Welcome to EDA 2!`

## Windows

1. [Install WSL with Ubuntu](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/en/latest/guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2/) (Linux subsystem inside Windows)

2. Follow the instructions for [Linux](#linux) in a WSL terminal

> [!NOTE]  
> You could compile and run C code directly on Windows. However, the repository template only works on WSL. Thus, you might need to adapt it for it to work. We recommend using WSL instead to avoid problems.

# How to run

```zsh
make r
```

# How to run unit tests

```zsh
make t
```

# How to format the code

```zsh
make f
```

# How to use Valgrind to check for memory leaks

```zsh
make v
```

# How to run unit tests in GitHub

When you push to GitHub, your [unit tests will automatically run](.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml). Check out the results and logs in the Actions tab of your repository (in GitHub).

# How to debug

```zsh
make d
```

You can also use `make dt` to debug the unit tests.

Then, you can:
- Start the program
```zsh
run
```

- View the stack trace
```zsh
backtrace
```

- Move through the stack trace
```zsh
up
down
```

- Print a variable
```zsh
print x
```

- Set a breakpoint at the beginning of a function
```zsh
break my_function_name
```

- Set a breakpoint at a specific line
```zsh
break my_file.c:24
```

- Continue after hitting a breakpoint
```zsh
continue
```

- Execute only the next command after hitting a breakpoint
```zsh
step
```

- Execute only the next line after hitting a breakpoint
```zsh
next
```
