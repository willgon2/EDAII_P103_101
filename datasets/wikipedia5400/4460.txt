Australian English
[Australia](1659)n English (AusE, AusEng, AuE, AuEng, en-AU) is the set of varieties of the [English language](4401) native to [Australia](1659). It is the country's common language and de facto national language; while [Australia](1659) has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, and has been entrenched as the de facto national language since British settlement, being the only language spoken in the home for 72% of [Australia](1659)ns. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts.
[Australia](1659)n English began to diverge from British and Hiberno-English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in 1788. [Australia](1659)n English arose from a dialectal melting pot created by the intermingling of early settlers who were from a variety of dialectal regions of Great Britain and Ireland, though its most significant influences were the dialects of South East England. By the 1820s, the native-born colonists' speech was recognisably distinct from speakers in Britain and Ireland.
[Australia](1659)n English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. [Australia](1659)n English is relatively consistent across the continent, although it encompasses numerous regional and sociocultural varieties. "General [Australia](1659)n" describes the de facto standard dialect, which is perceived to be free of pronounced regional or sociocultural markers and is often used in the media.

History
The earliest [Australia](1659)n English was spoken by the first generation of native-born colonists in the Colony of New South Wales from the end of the 18th century. These native-born children were exposed to a wide range of dialects from across the [British Isles](4499). Similar to early [American English](1173), the process of dialect levelling and koineisation which ensued produced a relatively homogeneous new variety of English which was easily understood by all. Peter Miller Cunningham's 1827 book Two Years in New South Wales described the distinctive accent and vocabulary that had developed among the native-born colonists.
The dialects of South East England, including most notably the traditional Cockney dialect of London, were particularly influential on the development of the new variety and constituted "the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing" [Australia](1659)n English. All the other regions of England were represented among the early colonists. A large proportion of early convicts and colonists were from Ireland, and spoke Irish as a sole or first language. They were joined by other non-native speakers of English from Scotland and Wales.
The first of the [Australia](1659)n gold rushes in the 1850s began a large wave of immigration, during which about two percent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. The Gold Rushes brought immigrants and linguistic influences from many parts of the world. An example was the introduction of vocabulary from [American English](1173), including some terms later considered to be typically [Australia](1659)n, such as bushwhacker and squatter. This American influence was continued with the popularity of American films from the early 20th century and the influx of American military personnel that settled in [Australia](1659) and New Zealand during World War II; seen in the enduring persistence of such universally-accepted terms as okay and guys.
The publication of Edward Ellis Morris's Austral English: A Dictionary Of Australasian Words, Phrases And Usages in 1898, which extensively catalogued [Australia](1659)n English vocabulary, started a wave of academic interest and codification during the 20th century which resulted in [Australia](1659)n English becoming established as an endonormative variety with its own internal norms and standards. This culminated in publications such as the 1981 first edition of the Macquarie Dictionary, a major [English language](4401) dictionary based on [Australia](1659)n usage, and the 1988 first edition of The [Australia](1659)n National Dictionary, a historical dictionary documenting the history of [Australia](1659)n English vocabulary and idiom.

Phonology and pronunciation
The most obvious way in which [Australia](1659)n English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation. It shares most similarity with New Zealand English. Like most dialects of English, it is distinguished primarily by the phonetic quality of its vowels.

Vowels
The vowels of [Australia](1659)n English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include monophthongs and diphthongs, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of Received Pronunciation (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels.
There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving [Australia](1659)n English phonemic length distinction, which is also present in some regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US. An example of this feature is the distinction between ferry /ˈfeɹiː/ and fairy /ˈfeːɹiː/.
As with New Zealand English and General [American English](1173), the weak-vowel merger is complete in [Australia](1659)n English: unstressed /ɪ/ is merged into /ə/ (schwa), unless it is followed by a velar consonant. Examples of this feature are the following pairings, which are pronounced identically in [Australia](1659)n English: Rosa's and roses, as well as Lennon and Lenin. Other examples are the following pairs, which rhyme in [Australia](1659)n English: abbott with rabbit, and dig it with bigot.
Most varieties of [Australia](1659)n English exhibit only a partial trap-bath split. The words bath, grass and can't are always pronounced with the "long" /aː/ of father. Throughout the majority of the country, the "flat" /æ/ of man is the dominant pronunciation for the a vowel in the following words: dance, advance, plant, example and answer. The exception is the state of South [Australia](1659), where a more advanced trap-bath split is found, and where the dominant pronunciation of all the preceding words incorporates the "long" /aː/ of father.

Consonants
There is little variation in the sets of consonants used in different English dialects but there are variations in how these consonants are used. [Australia](1659)n English is no exception.

[Australia](1659)n English is uniformly non-rhotic; that is, the /ɹ/ sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant. As with many non-rhotic dialects, linking /ɹ/ can occur when a word that has a final ⟨r⟩ in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An intrusive /ɹ/ may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have ⟨r⟩ in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel /oː/ and after word final /ə/. This can be heard in "law-r-and order", where an intrusive R is voiced between the AW and the A.
As with North [American English](1173), intervocalic alveolar flapping is a feature of [Australia](1659)n English: prevocalic /t/ and /d/ surface as the alveolar tap ɾ after sonorants other than /m, ŋ/ as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. Examples of this feature are that the following pairs are pronounced similarly or identically: latter and ladder, as well as rated and raided.
Yod-dropping generally occurs after /s/, /l/, /z/, /θ/ but not after /t/, /d/ and /n/. Accordingly, suit is pronounced as /sʉːt/, lute as /lʉːt/, Zeus as /zʉːs/ and enthusiasm as /enˈθʉːziːæzəm/. Other cases of /sj/ and /zj/, as well as /tj/ and /dj/, have coalesced to /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ respectively for many speakers. /j/ is generally retained in other consonant clusters.
In common with most varieties of Scottish English and [American English](1173), the phoneme /l/ is pronounced by [Australia](1659)ns as a "dark" (velarised) l (ɫ) in almost all positions, unlike other dialects such as Received Pronunciation, Hiberno (Irish) English, etc.

Pronunciation
Differences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between [Australia](1659)n English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility.
The affixes -ary, -ery, -ory, -bury, -berry and -mony (seen in words such as necessary, mulberry and matrimony) can be pronounced either with a full vowel (/ˈnesəseɹiː, ˈmalbeɹiː, ˈmætɹəməʉniː/) or a schwa  (/ˈnesəsəɹiː, ˈmalbəɹiː, ˈmætɹəməniː/). Although some words like necessary are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of [Australia](1659)ns are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa as is typical in [British English](4497). Meanwhile, younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel.
Words ending in unstressed -ile derived from Latin adjectives ending in -ilis are pronounced with a full vowel, so that fertile /ˈfɜːtɑɪl/ sounds like fur tile rather than rhyming with turtle /ˈtɜːtəl/.
In addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to various isolated words, with some of those pronunciations being unique to [Australia](1659)n English. For example:

As with [American English](1173), the vowel in yoghurt /ˈjəʉɡət/ and the prefix homo- /ˈhəʉməʉ/ (as in homosexual or homophobic) are pronounced with GOAT rather than LOT;
Vitamin, migraine and privacy are all pronounced with /ɑɪ/ in the stressed syllable (/ˈvɑɪtəmən, ˈmɑɪɡɹæɪn, ˈpɹɑɪvəsiː/) rather than /ˈvɪtəmən, ˈmiːɡɹæɪn, ˈpɹɪvəsiː/;
Dynasty and patronise, by contrast, are usually subject to trisyllabic laxing (/ˈdɪnəstiː, ˈpætrɔnɑɪz/) like in Britain, alongside US-derived /ˈdɑɪnəstiː, ˈpæɪtrɔnɑɪz/;
The prefix paedo- (as in paedophile) is pronounced /ˈpedəʉ/ rather than /ˈpiːdəʉ/;
In loanwords, the vowel spelled with ⟨a⟩ is often nativized as the PALM vowel (/aː/), as in [American English](1173), rather than the TRAP vowel (/æ/), as in [British English](4497). For example, pasta is pronounced /ˈpaːstə/, analogous to [American English](1173) /ˈpɑstə/, rather than /ˈpæstə/, as in [British English](4497).
Urinal is stressed on the first syllable and with the schwa for I: /ˈjʉːɹənəl/;
Harass and harassment are pronounced with the stress on the second, rather than the first syllable;
The suffix -sia (as in Malaysia, Indonesia and Polynesia, but not Tunisia) is pronounced /-⁠ʒə/ rather than /-ziːə/;
The word foyer is pronounced /ˈfoɪə/, rather than /ˈfoɪæɪ/;
Tomato, vase and data are pronounced with /aː/ instead of /æɪ/: /təˈmaːtəʉ, vaːz, ˈdaːtə/, with /ˈdæɪtə/ being uncommon but acceptable;
Zebra and leisure are pronounced /ˈzebɹə/ and /ˈleʒə/ rather than /ˈziːbɹə/ and /ˈliːʒə/, both having disyllabic laxing;
Status varies between British-derived /ˈstæɪtəs/ with the FACE vowel and American-derived /ˈstætəs/ with the TRAP vowel;
Conversely, precedence, precedent and derivatives are mainly pronounced with the FLEECE vowel in the stressed syllable, rather than DRESS: /ˈpɹiːsədəns ~ pɹiːˈsiːdəns, ˈpɹiːsədənt/;
Basil is pronounced /ˈbæzəl/, rather than /ˈbæɪzəl/;
Conversely, cache is usually pronounced /kæɪʃ/, rather than the more conventional /kæʃ/;
Buoy is pronounced as /boɪ/ (as in boy) rather than /ˈbʉːiː/;
The E in congress and progress is not reduced: /ˈkɔnɡɹes, ˈpɹəʉɡɹes/;
Conversely, the unstressed O in silicon, phenomenon and python stands for a schwa: /ˈsɪlɪkən, fəˈnɔmənən, ˈpɑɪθən/;
In Amazon, Lebanon, marathon and pantheon, however, the unstressed O stands for the LOT vowel, somewhat as with [American English](1173): /ˈæməzɔn, ˈlebənɔn, ˈmæɹəθɔn, ˈpænθæɪɔn/;
The colour name maroon is pronounced with the GOAT vowel: /məˈɹəʉn/.

Variation
Relative to many other national dialect groupings, [Australia](1659)n English is relatively homogeneous across the country. Some relatively minor regional differences in pronunciation exist. A limited range of word choices is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals may be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular [Australia](1659)n states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions. In addition, some [Australia](1659)ns speak creole languages derived from [Australia](1659)n English, such as [Australia](1659)n Kriol, Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk.
Academic research has also identified notable sociocultural variation within [Australia](1659)n English, which is mostly evident in phonology.

Regional variation
Although [Australia](1659)n English is relatively homogeneous, there are some regional variations. The dialects of English spoken in the various states and territories of [Australia](1659) differ slightly in vocabulary and phonology.
Most regional differences are in word usage. Swimming clothes are known as cossies, /ˈkɔziːz/ togs or swimmers in New South Wales, togs in Queensland, and bathers in Victoria, Tasmania, Western [Australia](1659) and South [Australia](1659). What Queensland calls a stroller is usually called a pram in Victoria, Western [Australia](1659), South [Australia](1659), New South Wales, and Tasmania.
Preference for some synonymous words also differ between states. Garbage (i.e., garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over rubbish in New South Wales and Queensland, while rubbish is more popular in Victoria, Tasmania, Western [Australia](1659) and South [Australia](1659).
Additionally, the word footy generally refers to the most popular football code in an area; that is, rugby league or rugby union depending on the local area, in most of New South Wales and Queensland. More commonly "rugby" is used to distinguish rugby union from "footy" which refers to the more popular rugby league. Footy commonly is used for [Australia](1659)n rules football elsewhere however the term refers to the both  prominent codes, rugby league and [Australia](1659)n rules football, interchangeably, depending on context of usage outside of regional perrameters. In some pockets of Melbourne & Western Sydney "football" and more rarely "footy" will refer to Association football although unlike more common international terminology, [Australia](1659)n English uses the term soccer and not football or footy. Beer glasses are also named differently in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative eh (also spelled ay or aye), which is particularly associated with Queensland. Secret Santa () and Kris Kringle are used in all states, with the former being more common in Queensland.

South [Australia](1659)
The most pronounced variation in phonology is between South [Australia](1659) and the other states and territories. The trap–bath split is more complete in South [Australia](1659), in contrast to the other states. Accordingly, words such as dance, advance, plant, example and answer are pronounced with /aː/ (as in father) far more frequently in South [Australia](1659) while the older /æ/ (as in mad) is dominant elsewhere in [Australia](1659). L-vocalisation is also more common in South [Australia](1659) than other states.

Centring diphthongs
In Western [Australia](1659)n and Queensland English, the vowels in near and square are typically realised as centring diphthongs (nɪə, skweə), whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs: nɪː, skweː.

Salary–celery merger
A feature common in Victorian English is salary–celery merger, whereby a Victorian pronunciation of Ellen may sound like Alan and Victoria's capital city Melbourne may sound like Malbourne to speakers from other states. There is also regional variation in /ʉː/ before /l/ (as in school and pool).

Full-fool allophones
In some parts of [Australia](1659), notably Victoria, a fully backed allophone of /ʉː/, transcribed ʊː, is common before /l/. As a result, the pairs full/fool and pull/pool differ phonetically only in vowel length for those speakers. The usual allophone for /ʉː/ is further forward in Queensland and New South Wales than Victoria.

Sociocultural variation
The General [Australia](1659)n accent serves as the standard variety of English across the country. According to linguists, it emerged during the 19th century. General [Australia](1659)n is the dominant variety across the continent, and is particularly so in urban areas. The increasing dominance of General [Australia](1659)n reflects its prominence on radio and television since the latter half of the 20th century.
Recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the Broad sociocultural variant, which differs from General [Australia](1659)n in its phonology. The Broad variant is found across the continent and is relatively more prominent in rural and outer-suburban areas.
A largely historical Cultivated sociocultural variant, which adopted features of British Received Pronunciation and which was commonplace in official media during the early 20th century, had become largely extinct by the onset of the 21st century.
[Australia](1659)n Aboriginal English is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of [Australia](1659), and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard [Australia](1659)n English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use.
Academics have noted the emergence of numerous ethnocultural dialects of [Australia](1659)n English that are spoken by people from some minority non-English speaking backgrounds. These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General [Australia](1659)n English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-[English language](4401) features, such as [Afro-Asiatic](1789) languages and languages of Asia. Samoan English is also influencing [Australia](1659)n English. Other ethnolects include those of Lebanese and Vietnamese [Australia](1659)ns.
A high rising terminal in [Australia](1659)n English was noted and studied earlier than in other varieties of English. The feature is sometimes called [Australia](1659)n questioning intonation. Research published in 1986, regarding vernacular speech in Sydney, suggested that high rising terminal was initially spread by young people in the 1960s. It found that the high rising terminal was used more than twice as often by young people than older people, and is more common among women than men. In the United Kingdom, it has occasionally been considered one of the variety's stereotypical features, and its spread there is attributed to the popularity of [Australia](1659)n soap operas.

Vocabulary
Intrinsic traits
[Australia](1659)n English has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect.

Commonly known
Internationally well-known examples of [Australia](1659)n terminology include outback, meaning a remote, sparsely populated area, the bush, meaning either a native forest or a country area in general, and g'day, a greeting. Dinkum, or fair dinkum means "true", "legitimate" or "is that true?", among other things, depending on context and inflection. The derivative dinky-di means "true" or devoted: a "dinky-di Aussie" is a "true [Australia](1659)n".

Historical references
[Australia](1659)n poetry, such as "The Man from Snowy River", as well as folk songs such as "Waltzing Matilda", contain many historical [Australia](1659)n words and phrases that are understood by [Australia](1659)ns even though some are not in common usage today.

[British English](4497) similarities and differences
[Australia](1659)n English, in common with [British English](4497), uses the word mate to mean friend, as well as the word bloody as a mild expletive or intensifier. "Mate" is also used in multiple ways including to indicate "mateship" or formally call out the target of a threat or insult, depending on internation and context.
Several words used by [Australia](1659)ns were at one time used in the UK but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there. For example, creek in [Australia](1659), as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it is typically a watercourse in a marshy area; paddock in [Australia](1659) means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; bush or scrub in [Australia](1659), as in North America, means a natural, uncultivated area of vegetation or flora, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as Shepherd's Bush and Wormwood Scrubs).

Aboriginal-derived words
Some elements of Aboriginal languages have been adopted by [Australia](1659)n English—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example dingo) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general [Australia](1659)n use, while others, such as kangaroo, boomerang, budgerigar, wallaby and so on have become international. Other examples are cooee and hard yakka. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced /ˈkʉːiː/) which travels long distances. Cooee is also a notional distance: "if he's within cooee, we'll spot him". Hard yakka means "hard work" and is derived from yakka, from the Jagera/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.
The word bung, meaning "dead" was originally a Yagara word which was used in the pidgin widely spoken across [Australia](1659).

Places
Many towns or suburbs of [Australia](1659) have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The best-known example is the capital, Canberra, named after a local Ngunnawal language word thought to mean "women's breasts" or "meeting place".

Figures of speech and abbreviations
Litotes, such as "not bad", "not much" and "you're not wrong", are also used.
[Diminutive](2650)s and hypocorisms are common and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are arvo (afternoon), barbie (barbecue), smoko (cigarette break), Aussie ([Australia](1659)n) and Straya ([Australia](1659)). This may also be done with people's names to create nicknames (other English speaking countries create similar diminutives). For example, "Gazza" from Gary, or "Smitty" from John Smith. The use of the suffix -o originates in Irish: ó, which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in [Australia](1659)n English.
In informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as "sweet as" (as in "That car is sweet as."). "Full", "fully" or "heaps" may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in "The waves at the beach were heaps good."). This was more common in regional [Australia](1659) and South [Australia](1659) but has been in common usage in urban [Australia](1659) for decades. The suffix "-ly" is sometimes omitted in broader [Australia](1659)n English. For instance, "really good" can become "real good".

Measures
[Australia](1659)'s switch to the metric system in the 1970s changed most of the country's vocabulary of measurement from imperial to metric measures. Since the switch to metric, heights of individuals are listed in centimetres on official documents and distances by road on signs are listed in terms of kilometres and metres.

Comparison with other varieties
Where British and [American English](1173) vocabulary differs, sometimes [Australia](1659)n English shares a usage with one of those varieties, as with petrol (AmE: gasoline) and mobile phone (AmE: cellular phone) which are shared with [British English](4497), or truck (BrE: lorry) and eggplant (BrE: aubergine) which are shared with [American English](1173).
In other circumstances, [Australia](1659)n English sometimes favours a usage which is different from both British and [American English](1173) as with:

Grammar
The general rules which apply to [Australia](1659)n English are described at English grammar. Grammatical differences between varieties of English are minor relative to differences in phonology and vocabulary and do not generally affect intelligibility. Examples of grammatical differences between [Australia](1659)n English and other varieties include:

Collective nouns are generally singular in construction, e.g., the government was unable to decide as opposed to the government were unable to decide or the group was leaving as opposed to the group were leaving. This is in common with [American English](1173).
[Australia](1659)n English has an extreme distaste for the modal verbs shall (in non-legal contexts), shan't and ought (in place of will, won't and should respectively), which are encountered in [British English](4497). However, shall is found in the [Australia](1659)n Constitution, Acts of Parliament, and other formal or legal documents such as contracts.
Using should with the same meaning as would, e.g. I should like to see you, encountered in [British English](4497), is almost never encountered in [Australia](1659)n English.
River follows the name of the river in question, e.g., Brisbane River, rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., River Thames. This is also the case in North American and New Zealand English. In South [Australia](1659)n English however, the reverse applies when referring to the following three rivers: Murray, Darling and Torrens. The Derwent in Tasmania also follows this convention.
While prepositions before days may be omitted in [American English](1173), i.e., She resigned Thursday, they are retained in [Australia](1659)n English: She resigned on Thursday. This is shared with [British English](4497).
The institutional nouns hospital and university do not take the definite article: She's in hospital, He's at university. This is in contrast to [American English](1173) where the is required: In the hospital, At the university.
On the weekend is used in favour of the British at the weekend which is not encountered in [Australia](1659)n English.
Ranges of dates use to, i.e., Monday to Friday, rather than Monday through Friday. This is shared with [British English](4497) and is in contrast to [American English](1173).
When speaking or writing out numbers, and is always inserted before the tens, i.e., one hundred and sixty-two rather than one hundred sixty-two. This is in contrast to [American English](1173), where the insertion of and is acceptable but nonetheless either casual or informal.
The preposition to in write to (e.g. "I'll write to you") is always retained, as opposed to American usage where it may be dropped.
[Australia](1659)n English does not share the British usage of read (v) to mean "study" (v). Therefore, it may be said that "He studies medicine" but not that "He reads medicine".
When referring to time, [Australia](1659)ns will refer to 10:30 as half past ten and do not use the British half ten. Similarly, a quarter to ten is used for 9:45 rather than (a) quarter of ten, which is sometimes found in [American English](1173).
[Australia](1659)n English does not share the [British English](4497) meaning of sat to include sitting or seated. Therefore, uses such as I've been sat here for an hour are not encountered in [Australia](1659)n English.
To have a shower or have a bath are the most common usages in [Australia](1659)n English, in contrast to [American English](1173) which uses take a shower and take a bath.
The past participle of saw is sawn (e.g. sawn-off shotgun) in [Australia](1659)n English, in contrast to the [American English](1173) sawed.
The verb visit is transitive in [Australia](1659)n English. Where the object is a person or people, [American English](1173) also uses visit with, which is not found in [Australia](1659)n English.
An outdoor event which is cancelled due to inclement weather is rained out in [Australia](1659)n English. This is in contrast to [British English](4497) where it is said to be rained off.
In informal speech, sentence-final but may be used, e.g. "I don't want to go but" in place of "But I don't want to go". This is also found in Scottish English.
In informal speech, the discourse markers yeah no (or yeah nah) and no yeah (or nah yeah) may be used to mean "no" and "yes" respectively.

Spelling and style
As in all English-speaking countries, there is no central authority that prescribes official usage with respect to matters of spelling, grammar, punctuation or style.

Spelling
There are several dictionaries of [Australia](1659)n English which adopt a descriptive approach. The Macquarie Dictionary and the [Australia](1659)n Oxford Dictionary are most commonly used by universities, governments and courts as the standard for [Australia](1659)n English spelling.
[Australia](1659)n spelling is significantly closer to British than American spelling, as it did not adopt the systematic reforms promulgated in Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary. Notwithstanding, the Macquarie Dictionary often lists most American spellings as acceptable secondary variants.
The minor systematic differences which occur between [Australia](1659)n and American spelling are summarised below:

French-derived words which in [American English](1173) end with or, such as color, honor, behavior and labor, are spelt with our in [Australia](1659)n English: colour, honour, behaviour and labour. Exceptions are the [Australia](1659)n Labor Party and some (especially South [Australia](1659)n) placenames which use Harbor, notably Victor Harbor.
Words which in [American English](1173) end with ize, such as realize, recognize and apologize are spelt with ise in [Australia](1659)n English: realise, recognise and apologise. The British Oxford spelling, which uses the ize endings, remains a minority variant. The Macquarie Dictionary says that the -ise form as opposed to -ize sits at 3:1. The sole exception to this is capsize, which is used in all varieties.
Words which in [American English](1173) end with yze, such as analyze, paralyze and catalyze are spelt with yse in [Australia](1659)n English: analyse, paralyse and catalyse.
French-derived words which in [American English](1173) end with er, such as fiber, center and meter are spelt with re in [Australia](1659)n English: fibre, centre and metre (the unit of measurement only, not physical devices; so gasometer, voltmeter).
Words which end in [American English](1173) end with log, such as catalog, dialog and monolog are usually spelt with logue in [Australia](1659)n English: catalogue, dialogue and monologue; however, the Macquarie Dictionary lists the log spelling as the preferred variant for analog.
A double-consonant l is retained in [Australia](1659)n English when adding suffixes to words ending in l where the consonant is unstressed, contrary to [American English](1173). Therefore, [Australia](1659)n English favours cancelled, counsellor, and travelling over American canceled, counselor and traveling.
Where [American English](1173) uses a double-consonant ll in the words skillful, willful, enroll, distill, enthrall, fulfill and installment, [Australia](1659)n English uses a single consonant: skilful, wilful, enrol, distil, enthral, fulfil and instalment. However, the Macquarie Dictionary has noted a growing tendency to use the double consonant.
The [American English](1173) defense and offense are spelt defence and offence in [Australia](1659)n English.
In contrast with [American English](1173), which uses practice and license for both nouns and verbs, practice and licence are nouns while practise and license are verbs in [Australia](1659)n English.
Words with ae and oe are often maintained in words such as oestrogen and paedophilia, in contrast to the [American English](1173) practice of using e alone (as in estrogen and pedophilia). The Macquarie Dictionary has noted a shift within [Australia](1659)n English towards using e alone, and now lists some words such as encyclopedia, fetus, eon or hematite with the e spelling as the preferred variant and hence [Australia](1659)n English varies by word when it comes to these sets of words.
Minor systematic difference which occur between [Australia](1659)n and British spelling are as follows:

Words often ending in eable in [British English](4497) end in able in [Australia](1659)n English. Therefore, [Australia](1659)n English favours livable over liveable, sizable over sizeable, movable over moveable, etc., although both variants are acceptable.
Words often ending in eing in [British English](4497) end in ing in [Australia](1659)n English. Therefore, [Australia](1659)n English favours aging over ageing, or routing over routeing, etc., although both variants are acceptable.
Words often ending in mme in [British English](4497) end in m in [Australia](1659)n English. Therefore, [Australia](1659)n English favours program over programme (in all contexts) and aerogram over aerogramme, although both variants are acceptable. Similar to [Canada](1956), New Zealand and the [United States](1100), (kilo)gram is the only spelling.
Other examples of individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as being different from current British spellings include analog as opposed to analogue, guerilla as opposed to guerrilla, verandah as opposed to veranda, burqa as opposed to burka, pastie (noun) as opposed to pasty, neuron as opposed to neurone, hicup as opposed to hicough, annex as opposed to annexe, raccoon as opposed to racoon etc. Unspaced forms such as onto, anytime, alright and anymore are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts.
There is variation between and within varieties of English in the treatment of -t and -ed endings for past tense verbs. The Macquarie Dictionary does not favour either, but it suggests that leaped, leaned or  learned (with -ed endings) are more common but spelt and burnt (with -t endings) are more common.
Different spellings have existed throughout [Australia](1659)'s history. What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in [Australia](1659) throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and The Age newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the [Australia](1659)n Labor Party and also in some place names such as Victor Harbor. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary has been credited with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s. For a short time during the late 20th century, Harry Lindgren's 1969 spelling reform proposal (Spelling Reform 1 or SR1) gained some support in [Australia](1659) and was adopted by the [Australia](1659)n Teachers' Federation and minister Doug Everingham in personal correspondence.

Punctuation and style
Prominent general style guides for [Australia](1659)n English include the Cambridge Guide to [Australia](1659)n English Usage, the [Australia](1659)n Government Style Manual (formerly the Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers), the [Australia](1659)n Handbook for Writers and Editors and the Complete Guide to English Usage for [Australia](1659)n Students.
Both single and double quotation marks are in use, with single quotation marks preferred for use in the first instance, with double quotation marks reserved for quotes of speech within speech. Logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation is preferred for punctuation marks at the end of quotations. For instance, Sam said he 'wasn't happy when Jane told David to "go away"'. is used in preference to Sam said he "wasn't happy when Jane told David to 'go away.'"
The DD/MM/YYYY date format is followed and the 12-hour clock is generally used in everyday life (as opposed to service, police, and airline applications).
With the exception of screen sizes, metric units are used in everyday life, having supplanted imperial units upon the country's switch to the metric system in the 1970s, although imperial units persist in casual references to a person's height. Tyre and bolt sizes (for example) are defined in imperial units where appropriate for technical reasons.
In betting, decimal odds are used in preference to fractional odds, as used in the United Kingdom, or moneyline odds in the [United States](1100).

Keyboard layout
There are two major [English language](4401) keyboard layouts, the [United States](1100) layout and the United Kingdom layout. Keyboards and keyboard software for the [Australia](1659)n market universally uses the US keyboard layout, which lacks the pound (£), euro and negation symbols and uses a different layout for punctuation symbols from the UK keyboard layout.
